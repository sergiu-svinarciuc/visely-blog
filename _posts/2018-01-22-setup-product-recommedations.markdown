Hi everyone, I’m Alex, co-founder at nemo.ai, the team behind [Visely Product Recommendations][visely].

Some time ago we launched our brand new recommendation engine and integrated it with [Shopify][visely-app-store], which is an excellent e-commerce platform with a bustling app marketplace.
Our CEO, Sergiu Ciumac, has [done an excellent write-up][startup] on how we started our company.

So the dust has settled, customers have signed up and data has started to flow. It is time for us to share with the community some insights we’ve learned so far from real-world use cases of our product recommendation system.
In a series of articles, I’ll address several topics which we believe will be helpful for up and coming e-commerce entrepreneurs.
I’ll start with a four-part article talking about how to setup product recommendations widgets to maximise conversion. I’ll also dive deeper into product recommendation widgets. I’ll explain how a recommendation system attributes a purchase and I’ll lay out a simple framework of rules to help decide if your online store needs personalisation.
